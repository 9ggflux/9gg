# 9GG.FUN - $9GG Token Extension Launchpad

## Overview

9GG.FUN is a Solana-based launchpad for token creation, utilizing the Token-2022 standard to enable programmable extensions. It empowers developers to build advanced token mechanics, such as dynamic fees and reward systems, using languages like Rust, Python, or JavaScript. Launched as a PumpFun token on PumpSwap, $9GG powers a community-driven ecosystem with a marketplace for custom extensions, offering APIs and analytics to support developers.

## Features

- **Token-2022 Programmable Extensions**: Leverage features like transfer fees, interest-bearing tokens, and metadata to create custom mechanics (e.g., dynamic fees, staking flywheels) in Rust, Python, or JavaScript.
- **Tailored Flywheels**: Build self-sustaining ecosystems, such as liquidity flywheels or reward systems, using Token-2022 extensions.
- **Community-Driven Marketplace**: Publish, share, and monetize custom extensions, fostering an open-source, composable ecosystem powered by $9GG.
- **Developer API**: Integrate extensions into dApps seamlessly via the API (details at [xAI API](https://x.ai/api)).
- **Native Analytics**: Track token metrics like holder data, price action, and liquidity in real-time.

## Use Cases

### Reward Mechanisms
- **Transfer Fee Buybacks**: Use Token-2022’s transfer fee extension to collect fees on trades, funding automatic buybacks to reward holders.
- **Staking Rewards**: Create a flywheel with Token-2022’s interest-bearing feature, allowing holders to stake tokens and earn $9GG rewards.
- **Developer Incentives**: Developers earn $9GG by creating and sharing extensions in the Marketplace.

### Launch Protection
- **Immutable Metadata Transparency**: Embed immutable launch details using Token-2022’s metadata extension for transparency.
- **Governance Tokens for Fairness**: Use non-transferable tokens for launch governance to prevent sniping.
- **AI-Driven Risk Monitoring**: Detect and mitigate exploits like flash loan attacks in real-time.

### Growth Flywheels
- **Interest-Bearing Incentives**: Reward holders with additional tokens over time using Token-2022’s interest-bearing extension.
- **Liquidity Flywheel**: Allocate transfer fees to liquidity pools for price stability.
- **Ecosystem Expansion**: Community-voted extensions and API-driven dApp development expand token utility.

## Installation and Setup

> **Note**: 9GG.FUN is currently in beta as of June 06, 2025. Full platform functionality, including the Marketplace and API, will be available soon. The steps below are placeholders for future integration.
